## 💡 Why It Matters

Utility Gods embraces a small‑tool philosophy: better to have many lean, focused tools than one bulky monolith. Each utility addresses a specific need—improving development speed, maintainability, and joy.

We believe composable, focused tools are the building blocks of great software ecosystems.
